# About the project

https://rosmildolopes.github.io/Calculator/

Calculator is an static page that I made to improve my CSS skills while I was learning GRID and FLEXBOX

It was a great experience to learning how to manage better CSS and also working with gradient background, drop-shadow etc on a vanilla CSS
